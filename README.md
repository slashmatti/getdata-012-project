## Installation
The UCI HAR Data Set and a full description of it is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository; [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). Download and unzip with preserved folders the data set into the working directory of R.

## Usage
